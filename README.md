Note that everything in workspace is Symlinked to deliverables.
Differences between directory "deliverables" and directory "workspace"


Deliverables only contains the needed files for submission (based on assignment requirements)
Workspace will also contain test cases and result files.


Creating a Symlink:
```
ln -s <path_to_file>
```


Everything in the scripts directory should be run from the root directory of this repo.
